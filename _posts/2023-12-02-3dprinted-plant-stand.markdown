This Monstera plant was a friend's gift and it has been living in the floor a long time. Let's overengineer a fix for this, that at least takes 10 times more time than go buy a stool in the shop next door.

It uses a 3d platform piece and three 2cm diameter 40cm long wooden sticks and I glued all together because it was faster.
