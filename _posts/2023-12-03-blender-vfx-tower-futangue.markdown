I wanted to try adding 3d stuff to my drone footage in Lago Ranco, Chile. So it was a great opportunity to learn some basics on the  VFX tools in Blender.
I followed two tutorials for this.

Here is the result. There's several take aways. I need to learn proper lighting, I could match the actual shadows in the footage. I couldn't get a good material for the STONE. I would like the stome to be similar as the mountain. As if it was extracted from it. But is a start.
